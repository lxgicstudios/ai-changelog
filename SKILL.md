No install needed. Just run with npx. Node.js 18+ recommended. Needs OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

```bash
npx ai-changelog --help
```

## How It Works

Runs git log between your specified refs, collects all commit messages, and sends them to GPT-4o-mini. The AI parses the commits, understands what each change does, and formats them into proper Keep a Changelog style with appropriate categories.

## License

MIT. Free forever. Use it however you want.
